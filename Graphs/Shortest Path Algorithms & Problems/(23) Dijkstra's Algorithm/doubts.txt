1) Why is a priority queue used instead of a queue even when both return the same result?
=> The whole point of using a priority queue is to take the minimal node first. If we are using a queue we might come across a node
with a minimal distance and a maximum distance. So if we use a queue, it will take the maximum distance first and then check with the
adjacent nodes (assuming the maximum node comes first), only for it to be replaced by the same node with the minimum distance later on.
If we use a priority queue then it'll take the minimum distance one first and then only it will go for the maximum one. Since we found
a minimum distance one it will not act further with the node which has maximum distance. Refer image for example. 

2) Why is the TC = O(E log V)?
=> Just refer the video man.
